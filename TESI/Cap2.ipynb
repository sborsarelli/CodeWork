In a development exactly parallel with the control-law case, we can find a transformation to take a given system to observer canonical form if and only if the system has structural properties that in this case we call as mention just like above. Roughly speaking, observability refers to our ability to deduce information about all the modes of the system by monitoring only the sensed outputs.

    "## Estimator poles selection. The optimal full-state estimation \n",
    "In comparison with the selection of controllers poles, estimator poles selection require to be concerned with a much different relationship than with control effort. As in controller, there is a feedback term in the estimator that grows in magnitude as the requested speed of response increases. However this feedback is in the form of an electronic signal or a digital word in a computer, so its growth causes no special difficulty. The important consequence of increasing the speed of response of an estimator is that the bandwidth of the estimator becomes higher, thus causing more sensor noise to pass on to the control actuator. Like the controller the estimator design (and the poles selection) is a balance between good transient response and low-enough bandwidth that sensor noise does not significantly impact the actuator activity.   \n",

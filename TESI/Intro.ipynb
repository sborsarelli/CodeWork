    "# Preliminary fundamentals <a name=\"chapter1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a \"system\" in control theory? It's an insulated-enviroment composed from many parts that interact themselves where people want study the behaviour. It's composed of \"input variables\", like external forces, and \"output variables\" namely some characteristic of the system that it's important to study for some reason.\n",
    "In particular is interested to study the \"dynamic systems\" where variables have cause and effect and they are described from differential equation (also called memory systems). In particular the output doesn't depend only by input variables but the history also.\n",
    "A state variable is one of the set of variables that are used to describe the internal mathematical *state* of a dynamical system, which is determined by its history necessary to calculate the output.\n",
    "Intuitively, the state of a system describes enough about the system to determine its future behaviour in the absence of any external forces affecting the system. Models that consist of coupled first-order differential equations are said to be in state-variable form.\n",
    "There are some examples where state variables are used:\n",
    "\n",
    " - In mechanical systems, the position coordinates and velocities of mechanical parts are typical state variables\n",
    " - In thermodynamics, a state variable is an independent variable of a state function like internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy.\n",
    " - In electronic/electrical circuits, the voltages of the nodes and the currents through components in the circuit are usually the state variables.\n",
    " - In ecosystem models, population sizes (or concentrations) of plants, animals, and resources (nutrients, organic material) are typical state variables.\n",
    " - In pandemic models, restrictions(i.e. masks, lock-down, vaxines), percentage of cases, number of hospital beds, are used like state variables to create a control system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular of last point feedbacks are part of Control Engineering (or control systems engineering), a discipline that deals with control systems, applying control theory to design equipment and systems with desired behaviors in control environments. The practice uses sensors and detectors to measure the output performance of the process being controlled; these measurements are used to provide corrective feedback helping to achieve the desired performance. Systems designed to perform without requiring human input are called automatic control systems (such as cruise control for regulating the speed of a car). Multi-disciplinary in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by mathematical modeling of a diverse range of systems. \n",
    "There are two major divisions in control theory, namely, classical and modern, which have direct implications for the control engineering applications:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Classical SISO System Design**. The scope of classical control theory is limited to single-input and single-output system design, except when analyzing for disturbance rejection using a second input. The system analysis is carried out in the time domain using differential equations, in the complex-s domain with the Laplace transform, or in the frequency domain by transforming from the complex-s domain. Many systems may be assumed to have a second order and single variable system response in the time domain. The most common controllers designed using classical control theory are PID controllers. The ultimate end goal is to meet requirements typically provided in the time-domain called the step response, or at times in the frequency domain called the open-loop response. The step response characteristics applied in a specification are typically percent overshoot, settling time, etc. \n",
    " - **Modern MIMO system Design**. Modern control theory is carried out in the state space, and can deal with multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This overcomes the limitations of classical control theory in more sophisticated design problems, such as fighter aircraft control, with the limitation that no frequency domain analysis is possible. In modern design, a system is represented to the greatest advantage as a set of decoupled first order differential equations defined using state variables. Nonlinear, multivariable, adaptive and robust control theories come under this division.\n",
    "\n",
    "In state-space design, the control engineer designs a dynamic compensation by working directly  with the state-variable description of the system.\n",
    "Because it is particularly well suited to the use of the computer techniques, state-space design is increasingly studied and used today by control engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion of this paper starts from describing a dynamic system through an example passing to the state variable model, then the focus passes to the development of a state-variable equations and studying its block diagrams. Next steps are the way follow for a designer of feedback control:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Select closed-loop pole and develop the control law of the closed-loop system to satisfactory dynamics response.\n",
    " 2. Design an estimator\n",
    " 3. Combine the control law and the estimator\n",
    " 4. Introduce a reference input and track it robustly\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way to describe the goals of feedbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    " - obtain stability by the design\n",
    " - reduce the uncertainity by the compensation\n",
    " - resolve the disturbance also known as rejection\n",
    " - attenuating the sensor noise \n",
    " \n",
    "The main idea of state space comes of describing differential equations in a different method. By this way the dynamic is organized as a set of first order differential equations transformed in a vector-valued state of the system and the solution is visualized as a trajectory of this state vector space. State space control design is the technique in which the control engineer designs a dynamic compensation by working directly with the state variable description of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reason for studying equations in this form:\n",
    "\n",
    " - To study more general models: The ODE do not have to be linear or stationary\n",
    " - To introduce the ideas of geometry into differential equations: in physics the plane of position versus velocity of a particle is called the phase plane and the trajectory of the motion can be plotted as a curve in this plane. The main idea is to include inside the state more than two dimensions.\n",
    " - To connect internal and external description: the state of dynamics system often directly describes the distribution of internal energy in the system. The internal energy can always be computed from the state variables. In contrast, the transfer function relates only the input to the output and does not show the internal behavior \n",
    " - Advantage of state space design are especially apparent when the system to be controlled has more than one control input or more than one sensed output (MIMO systems).\n"
